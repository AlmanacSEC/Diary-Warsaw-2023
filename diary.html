        <h2>May 2nd, 2023</h2>
        <p>Hey Diary!</p>
        <p>Today has been a tiring day. I woke up at 3:00 in order to be at the airport early, and honestly, I was not having a great time. The flight landed at 9:00 in Warsaw, by that point I think we were all tired but there was a sense of excitement in the air. We took the bus to get brunch, we ate a really pretty vegan place, I wanted to try something different so I got a Moroccan breakfast. Needless to say, it was great and everyone immediately felt better after food, yet I was still worried about how I would get along with the others since I didn’t know many people.</p>
        <p>After this, we went to drop off our luggage and did a walking tour of Warsaw (excluding Praga). I’m so impressed by this city! It was not at all what I expected it to look like! Coming from Greece I expected a more Eastern European ~vibe~. It was very green and lush, the parks were stunning, the university library is by far the most impressive building I've ever laid my eyes on, the streets were big and every 15 minutes it felt like I was in a new city! After the tour, we went to the viewing deck on the Palace of Culture and Science where (for the first time ever!!!) I was as high as the 32nd floor!</p>
        <p>Today I also tried my first pierogi and let's just say I will definitely be coming back for more. That’s all for now!</p>
        <p>With love,<br>Perse</p>

        <p>Hey Diary!</p>
        <p>After some much-needed rest, we got up early and went to the Uprising Museum. Poland has such a rich history, unfortunately, you would not be able to actually tell from most parts of the city as it was bombed and burned :( After this museum, I have to say that I’m perceiving the city as a living monument. Walking through the old town yesterday was simply beautiful and finding out the history of it was so heartbreaking. But, it is so empowering to hear how the people of Poland persevered.</p>
        <p>Then we took a little food break and ate some local snacks from a kiosk. Afterward, we took some time to ourselves and met back up at the Vodka Museum!! I’m not a big fan of the drink but being in the land of vodka I was definitely excited to learn and taste. After learning about the origins and also the different ways in which Polish vodka is made we began the process of becoming recognized Polish vodka connoisseurs. After that, we decided to sit on the terrace (since the weather was very nice in comparison to what we get in Amsterdam) and have cocktails while watching the sunset. We made one last food stop at a small traditional Polish restaurant and headed back to the apartments.</p>

        <p>Hey Diary!</p>
        <p>It’s now day 3 in Poland and I am having an amazing time! Today we visited the POLIN Museum where we got to learn about the incredibly fascinating and rich history of Polish Jewish people. What was interesting about this museum is that it was not primarily focused on the Holocaust but rather on a broader history. I saw a reconstruction of what a Synagogue in Poland looked like, which as a non-Jewish individual I have never seen before.</p>
        <p>After the museum, we grabbed some Polish McDonalds (yes, I know that sounds disappointing). We all wanted to try the different menu options that exist in Poland but not in our home countries/ the Netherlands. It was pretty good but, definitely does not even compare to Polish cuisine.</p>
        <p>Next, we went to a Chopin piano concert which was rich with emotion (and even made some of us emotional). We then finished off the day by trying some zapiekanki which is a baguette with toppings and ketchup (it was mouth-wateringly good). Because we had some space for dessert we decided to try Trdelnik.</p>

        <h2>May 5th, 2023</h2>
        <p>Hey Diary!</p>
        <p>Today we went to the University of Warsaw to watch a private lecture on Sociology in Poland. We also got signed copies of books written by the professor that was lecturing us. It was interesting to find out how history has helped or inhibited the growth of sociology as a subject. The campus was beautiful with old architecture. We then went for lunch with the board members of the study association for Sociology, RSS.</p>
        <p>After this, we had some free time so some of us decided to go to the University Library which was an even more impressive building (maybe even the coolest building I’ve seen in my entire life). It was full of plants and greenery, with massive windows and more industrial construction. We went shopping for souvenirs in the old town. We went for a really good vegan dinner.</p>
        <p>Since this was our last night in Poland everyone was on board to go out and party!!! And so we did… and had a very interesting and academically enriching night! I don’t want to leave yet! Someone, please pay for this vacation to continue :’) Tomorrow we take our flight back to Amsterdam</p>
        <p>With love,<br>Perse</p>
